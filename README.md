# CS330-CompGraphic

## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me learn about the rendering process and the steps that lead to a complete 3D scene. 
I learned how to integrate textures, materials, and lighting to create 3D scenes using OpenGL.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process, beginning with basic 3D shapes to form my scene.
I used transformations on the 3D shapes to position, scale and rotate them into their positions.
Textures, materials, and light sources brought the scene to life and added realism.
Finally implementing camera controls to navigate the scene and change the camera projection allows the user to view the entire scene from multiple perspectives.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Using an iterative approach to create a scene by adding basic shapes, colors, textures, and light sources over time will help me to scale up to more complex 3D scenes in the future.
Knowledge of OpenGL and the rendering process provides a strong background that will support and work I do in computer graphics.

## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
By modularizing my code into separate classes and functions, I separated concerns for geometry creation, lighting, and camera navigation, making the codebase easier to understand and debug.
Identifying any processes in the code, such as rendering a mesh, that would become repetitive tasks and then abstracting away the code into a method helped to streamline my code and reduce repition.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was critical in this project. I continuously tested lighting, textures, and camera behavior, refining each element to ensure the scene's realism and interactivity.
Positioning the meshes in the 3D space was especially challenging, but making small changes, then rendering the project to inspect the meshes helped me to successfully position all of the shapes to form my scene.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I’ve become more structured in planning my approach to achieving milestones in my code projects, focusing on foundational components first and layering complexity incrementally.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computer Science provides a deeper understanding of rendering algorithms and spatial reasoning, valuable for advanced topics I could work on such as virtual reality, computer aided drafting, and game design.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Learning computer graphics sharpens my problem-solving and visual storytelling skills which is essential for industries like game development, engineering, or UX/UI design.
